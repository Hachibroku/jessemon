App that I am creating to mess with the pokemon api

To use the program clone it into a repo
cd into the project on two seperate powershells(cmd line)

on the first:
cd into the backend
run "node index.js" 
that will connect your backend to the port:3000 and to the MongoDB

on the second:
cd into frontend and run "npm install --save-dev vite"
then run "npm run dev"
that connects the vite frontend to port 5173
